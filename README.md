# Poet's Elixir Web Template

## Intro

I basically design as ideas come. I am not a designer but a developer so the design may not be as fanciful as other professional designs.

- I'll continue updating the code and this README as I progress.

## Polyfill

Since iOS doesn't support ```scroll-behavior: smooth;```, I added a polyfill. You can get the polyfill here: [smooth scroll pollyfill](https://unpkg.com/smoothscroll-polyfill@0.4.4/dist/smoothscroll.min.js)
